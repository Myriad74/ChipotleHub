This is a lua program formed from a money glitch vulnerability me and my friend discovered 

The Git I'm uploading to Github is also the first I've ever made, and it is very simple haha :)

All jokes aside, I would also like to thank my friend Doloro [Doloro1978] for working with me to discover and develop this exploit.

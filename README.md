**This is an exploit that was discovered on the Roblox game "Chipotle Burrito Builder"**

**What this exploit allows for you to do is gain as much in game currency as you want by "tricking" the server into thinking you have completed the delivery, and therefore just constantly giving you more money**

The Git I'm uploading to Github is also the first I've ever made, and it is very simple haha :)

All jokes aside, I would also like to thank my friend Doloro [Doloro1978] for working with me to discover and develop this exploit.
